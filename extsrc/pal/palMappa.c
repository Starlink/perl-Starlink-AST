*  Name:
*     palMappa

*  Purpose:
*     Compute parameters needed by palAmpqk and palMapqk.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     void palMappa( double eq, double date, double amprms[21] )

*  Arguments:
*     eq = double (Given)
*        epoch of mean equinox to be used (Julian)
*     date = double (Given)
*        TDB (JD-2400000.5)
*     amprms =   double[21]  (Returned)
*        star-independent mean-to-apparent parameters:
*        (0)      time interval for proper motion (Julian years)
*        (1-3)    barycentric position of the Earth (AU)
*        (4-6)    not used
*        (7)      not used
*        (8-10)   abv: barycentric Earth velocity in units of c
*        (11)     sqrt(1-v**2) where v=modulus(abv)
*        (12-20)  precession/nutation (3,3) matrix

*  Description:
*     Compute star-independent parameters in preparation for
*     transformations between mean place and geocentric apparent place.
*
*     The parameters produced by this function are required in the
*     parallax, aberration, and nutation/bias/precession parts of the
*     mean/apparent transformations.
*
*     The reference systems and timescales used are IAU 2006.

*  Notes:
*     - For date, the distinction between the required TDB and TT
*     is always negligible.  Moreover, for all but the most
*     critical applications UTC is adequate.
*     - The vector amprms(1-3) is referred to the mean equinox and
*     equator of epoch eq.
*     - The parameters amprms produced by this function are used by
*     palAmpqk, palMapqk and palMapqkz.
