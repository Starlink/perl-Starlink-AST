*  Name:
*     palEvp

*  Purpose:
*     Returns the barycentric and heliocentric velocity and position of the
*     Earth.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     void palEvp( double date, double deqx, double dvb[3], double dpb[3],
*                  double dvh[3], double dph[3] )

*  Arguments:
*     date = double (Given)
*        TDB (loosely ET) as a Modified Julian Date (JD-2400000.5)
*     deqx = double (Given)
*        Julian epoch (e.g. 2000.0) of mean equator and equinox of the
*        vectors returned.  If deqx <= 0.0, all vectors are referred to the
*        mean equator and equinox (FK5) of epoch date.
*     dvb = double[3] (Returned)
*        Barycentric velocity (AU/s, AU)
*     dpb = double[3] (Returned)
*        Barycentric position (AU/s, AU)
*     dvh = double[3] (Returned)
*        heliocentric velocity (AU/s, AU)
*     dph = double[3] (Returned)
*        Heliocentric position (AU/s, AU)

*  Description:
*     Returns the barycentric and heliocentric velocity and position of the
*     Earth at a given epoch, given with respect to a specified equinox.
*     For information about accuracy, see the function iauEpv00.
